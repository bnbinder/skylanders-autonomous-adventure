# skylanders-autonomous-adventure
Want to code autonomous, but it isnt as fun as it first was? Well, try the new, innovative, Skylanders: Autonomous Adventure! With this new design, creating autonomous code will always be fun! Put a skylander onto the scuffed portal of power, and it will write a line of autonomous code! (You can use any rfid tag for any code, doesnt need to be skylanders) <br>

notes <br>
- sklylanders: spryos adventures characters make the code repeat itself while anything else (all ive tested is adventure and giants) is a one time use, where you have to release to write the code again <br>
- i use vscode, so i dont know how this will work on other ides

arduino code is in the "arduino skylanders roborio code" repo

how to run: <br>
- download code into your robot code (in your autonomous folder) <br>
- change strings in beggining of file to change commands and imports used in the command file
- run py file <br>
- COM input requires a number (the arduino COM should show up before the input) <br>
- next inputs are self explanatory <br>
- once file is set up, put on skylanders to write code <br>
- press enter key (or any key) to stop script <br>
