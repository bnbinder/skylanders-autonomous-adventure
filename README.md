Want to code autonomous, but it isnt as fun as it first was? Well, try the new, innovative, Skylanders: Autonomous Adventure! With this new design, creating autonomous code will always be fun! Put a skylander onto the scuffed portal of power, and it will write a line of autonomous code! (You can use any rfid tag for any code, doesnt need to be skylanders)

note - sklylanders: spryos adventures characters make the code repeat itself while anything else (all ive tested is adventure and giants) is a one time use, where you have to release to write the code again
